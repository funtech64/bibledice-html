# 🎲 BibleDice.fun – Divine Dice for Daily Scripture

BibleDice is a grace-based Bible reading game powered by dice!  
Whether you're a kid, teen, or adult, the randomness makes reading God's Word fun, personal, and full of discovery.

📖 Roll two dice to land on a number from 10–66.  
📘 That number maps to one of the 66 books of the Bible.  
🎯 Use our linked chapter help pages and study guides to explore Scripture in a fresh, engaging way.
