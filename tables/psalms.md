# 📖 Psalms Roll Table

Explore the Book of Psalms using creative dice rolls! This guide helps you land in meaningful chapter ranges throughout this rich, poetic book.

🎲 **Dice Needed:**
- 1× D6 (standard 6-sided die)
- 2× D10s (one for tens place, one for ones)

Roll your D6 to determine your starting *decade range*, then use your D10s to generate the specific Psalm.

If you roll:
- **D6 = 1** → Psalms 10–29
- **D6 = 2** → Psalms 30–49
- **D6 = 3** → Psalms 50–69
- **D6 = 4** → Psalms 70–89
- **D6 = 5** → Psalms 90–109
- **D6 = 6** → Psalms 110–129

Then use your 2×D10 (tens + ones) to find the exact Psalm within that 20-chapter band.

📏 For example:
- D6 = 3 and D10+D10 = 16 → Psalm **66**
- D6 = 5 and D10+D10 = 08 → Psalm **98**

If your result goes out of bounds (e.g., Psalm 130+), loop back to Psalm 1–9 or re-roll with a bonus grace prompt!
