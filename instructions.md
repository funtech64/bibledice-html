# ðŸ“š Chapter Roll Die

Use this when a book has many chapters (50+), like **Psalms**, **Isaiah**, **Jeremiah**, or **Ezekiel**.

- Roll two dice:
  - **D6** = traditional square die
  - **D10** = diamond-shaped 10-sided die
- **First die = tens digit**, **second = ones digit**
- **Roll result = starting chapter**
- Read **2â€“5 chapters** from that point
- If the book has been read recently (last month), **subtract 9** from the result to push into less-read chapters

# ðŸ“˜ Bible Book Selector (Book Roll Guide)

Use this to select a book of the Bible by rolling a number between **10 and 66**.

- Roll two dice:
  - **D10** for the tens place
  - **D6** for the ones place
- Combine the result:
  - *Example:* D10 = 3, D6 = 5 â†’ **Book 35**

### Special Handling (If roll = 67â€“69):

Roll again with this mapping:

- **D6 = 1 or 4** â†’ Genesisâ€“Leviticus  
- **D6 = 2 or 5** â†’ Numbersâ€“Deuteronomy  
- **D6 = 3 or 6** â†’ Joshuaâ€“2 Samuel  

Then continue reading that bookâ€™s chapters as usual.
